🔐 **Passionate about Reverse Engineering, Forensics, and Cryptography**

🔍 I thrive on solving cybersecurity challenges—from breaking classic ciphers to digging through memory dumps and dissecting binaries. I sharpen my skills through hands-on work in encryption, malware analysis, and reverse engineering.

🏆 **CTF Enthusiast**  
I regularly play Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, where I dive into debuggers, binary exploitation, and network forensics. Finding flags and solving puzzles is my fuel.

📚 **Lifelong Learner**  
I’m always exploring deeper topics like elliptic curve cryptography, x86-64 assembly, and the latest in exploit development.
