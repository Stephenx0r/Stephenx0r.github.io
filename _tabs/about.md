🔐 I'm into reverse engineering, forensics, and pretty much anything that breaks or leaks.

🔍 I enjoy tearing stuff apart—whether it's dissecting binaries, digging through memory dumps, or figuring out strange behavior in code. I try to do a bit of everything and keep learning along the way.

🏆 I play CTFs regularly.  
Reverse engineering weird edge cases whatever it throws at me, I’m down to chase flags and piece together solutions.

📚 Always learning.  
From low-level assembly to subtle bugs and obscure behaviors, I’m always experimenting and picking up new tricks to get better at what I do.
