Writeups for CyberGame2025

I had the privilege to create EASY CTF challenges for the [P3rf3ctr00t CTF](https://perfectroot.wiki/)  held on the weekend of 15th - 17th November 2024. This was fun and successful being the first timing hosting a local CTF that attracted players from all over the world. I created 8 easy challenges summarized below:

| Challenge              | Solves/142 |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| SheetsNLayers - Flag 1 | 38         |
| See Ya                 | 33         |
| Dive                   | 25         |
| SheetsNLayers - Flag 2 | 21         |
| SheetsNLayers - Flag 3 | 21         |
| SheetsNLayers - Flag 4 | 20         |
| tGIF                   | 16         |
| YAZ (Yet Another Zine) | 5          |
