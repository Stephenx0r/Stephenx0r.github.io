This is a writeup for beginner, forensics and OSINT challenges from WolvCTF 2024. I really enjoyed the beginner category where the authors allowed players to discuss certain questions in the Discord chat to learn together. I had troubles with learning Burpsuite in the past but this really gave me an idea how it works and what functions it has.

## Forensics: Hidden Data [Beginner]
Question: WOLPHV sent me this file. Not sure what to comment about it

Flag: `wctf{h1dd3n_d4t4_n0T_s0_h1dD3N}`

We are given an image of the CTF logo. Just use Aperi'Solve and the flag can be found within its data.
