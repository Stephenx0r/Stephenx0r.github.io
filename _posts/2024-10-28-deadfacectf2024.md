## Reverse Engineering
## Cereal Killer 01

We are given a binary and an executable file.  Running the executable we are prompted for a password I loaded up the binary file in IDA Pro and looked at the strings maybe the password is hardcoded lets see! 
![pic1.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic3.png)The string `obboreel` stands out trying it out as the password and it was not the password.
I did spin up x64dbg to debug the file and set a breakpoint before the jump of printing the bad message Access Denied.

After

The input is being reversed the word `booberry` looking up the word its a cereal and trying it out it was definetly the  password and we get the flag!

Running the binary gave me the cryptic message, “Please enter the password.” Challenge accepted.
I tossed this bad boy into IDA Pro, and right away, I zeroed in on the function `sub_13DC`. The name didn’t scream “password handler,” but it was clearly doing _something_ important. A few strings in the output hinted it might be a password validation function, so let’s crack it wide open.

### `sub_13DC` – The Password Sieve

So, we’ve got a big ol' pile of variables in here—`s`, `s1`, `s2`, and some more arrays. This is where the binary initializes everything, probably hashing or messing with the password input in some convoluted way. Here’s the fun part:

1. **The Password Prompt**: The function prompts for the password, which gets shoved into `inputpassword`. Right after, a string of mysterious sub-functions start grinding away at the input. This was a clear invitation to reverse engineer each one.
    
2. **Breaking Down the Mystery Functions**: First up, `sub_132F`. This function takes a string like `"976e86dafec99d2da69bbaa762aba8cc"` and stores some hashed result into `s2`. It was hashing hardcoded strings, which meant the binary was expecting something specific to pass that check 
3. So, after finding the password _yellowschoolbus_  using the hash `104e5dc03561ebf96acf9a0b2b5f184f` online, I confidently punched it into the binary. But guess what? It didn’t work! Classic case of getting your hopes up, right?

Then I spotted that sneaky second hash, `976e86dafec99d2da69bbaa762aba8cc`. I knew that one was going to need some serious firepower, likely requiring Hashcat to crack it.

 Instead, I opted to patch the program. I mean, who wouldn’t choose a shortcut when the end goal is just a patch away? So, I skipped the hassle of cracking that second hash, and just like that, I was ready to snag the flag without any fuss!

To really wrap things up, I decided to NOP (No Operation) the `JNE` instruction in the binary.

*We’ve conquered the 250-point challenges, and now it's time to gear up for the big leagues as we tackle the 500-point ones!*


When analyzing the pseudocode we see the password is being hashed inspecting the memory layout I did set a breakpoint before  jump is taken the `cmp eax, [ecx]`  synchronizing the `ecx` variable with the hex view we can see our input password `stephen` is md5 hashed` 7F F3 67 97 53 91 30 F7 74 45 F4 8D A5 D4 A1 26`

![pic12.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic12.png)The correct password being saved in the `edx` register I synchronized it as well and it sits on top of the `ecx` register `EC C8 8B 0A F9 02 53 E8 70 06 97 4B 2F 3F DC `


I did assemble the `edx` bytes to the `ecx` to make a match for the comparison to pass

Running the binary we see Access Violation occurred. Ahem seems like its trying to access a memory location that is not valid. Upon inspecting the strings and the source code we see the Windows API functions like `VirtualAlloc` and `VirtualProtect`

![pic23.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic23.png)


We see the program accesses an invalid memory location `2BAD2BAD` I did set an `ip`
to another instruction from the call  accessing the  invalid memory location
![pic17.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic17.png)


We see the program  tries again to access an invalid memory location `DEADFACE` I did set an `ip`
to another instruction from the call  accessing the  invalid memory location running the executable it terminated. I did inspect  the last call to the invalid memory location  `DEADFACE` by stepping into it 

![pic18.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic18.png)

We see as highlighted below the invalid memory address being saved to `eax` and a jmp being made to it causing an access violation error. 
![pic20.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic20.png)


I did set an `ip` after the `jmp` instruction 
![pic21.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic21.png)

The executable loads `dll's` and loads an audio from a remote server and  plays it reading the flag out loud!

We are given a jar file running it we see it requires a password 
![[Pasted image 20241031212750.png]]

**1. Decompiling**  
First, I opened the JAR file in `jadx-gui` and found the XOR function used to decrypt a URL. Here's the relevant function:

`private static byte[] decryptURL(byte[] bArr, String str) {
    byte[] bArr2 = new byte[bArr.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < bArr.length; i++) {
        bArr2[i] = (byte) (bArr[i] ^ str.charAt(i % str.length()));
    }
    return bArr2;
}
`

![[Pasted image 20241031211957.png]]
The XOR function loops through `encryptedURL`, applying a password in a repeating cycle. 

The challenge required us to decrypt an encrypted URL using a password. While the password wasn’t explicitly stated, the decryption function provided a key insight: it checks if the decrypted URL starts with `"https."` This led me to deduce that the password itself might be derived from the string format of the URL. Given that "https" is a common prefix for secure web addresses, it became a logical choice for the password to successfully decrypt the byte array.

By using "https" as the key, we were able to reverse the XOR operation, revealing the full URL.. Since XOR is a reversible operation, I crafted a quick Python script to perform the decryption:

`encrypted_url = [42, 6, 68, 64, 7, 120, 93, 31, 83, 17, 48, 23, 81, 92, 90, 46, 11, 68, 68, 27, 44, 30, 81, 82, 7, 108, 29, 66, 87, 91, 33, 23, 66, 85, 21, 46, 1, 31, 86, 6, 45, 29, 68, 82, 6, 45, 29, 68, 30, 30, 50, 23, 87]`

`Known plaintext prefix`
`prefix = "https"`

`Derive key from prefix and first few bytes of encrypted_url`
`key = [encrypted_url[i] ^ ord(prefix[i]) for i in range(len(prefix))]`

`Extend key to match the length of encrypted_url`
`full_key = (key * (len(encrypted_url) // len(key) + 1))[:len(encrypted_url)]`

`Decrypt the URL`
`decrypted_url = ''.join(chr(b ^ k) for b, k in zip(encrypted_url, full_key))`

`print("Derived Password (Key):", ''.join(chr(k) for k in key))`
`print("Decrypted URL:", decrypted_url)`
`
