We are given a binary and an executable file.  Running the executable we are prompted for a password I loaded up the binary file in IDA Pro and looked at the strings maybe the password is hardcoded lets see! 
![pic1.png](/assets/posts/deadface2024/pic3.png)The string `obboreel` stands out trying it out as the password and it was not the password.
I did spin up x64dbg to debug the file and set a breakpoint before the jump of printing the bad message Access Denied.

The input is being reversed the word `booberry` looking up the word its a cereal and trying it out it was definetly the  password and we get the flag!
