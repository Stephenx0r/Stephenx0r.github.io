# XS2: Looper - xor school

![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/1108c710-b744-4ced-ae6b-3edf7aa1681b)


### Get Part of the XOR Key
To kick things off, We leveraged the magic of knowing the flag format udctf{. XORing this snippet against the start of the ciphertext started to reveal a familiar, cheeky pattern in CTFs: `deadbe`. At this point, the puzzle pieces were coming together.



``` python
def xor(msg, key):
    o = b''
    for i in range(len(msg)):
        o += bytes([msg[i] ^ key[i % len(key)]])
    return o

ciphertext_hex = "11010210041e125508065109073a11563b1d51163d16060e54550d19"
ciphertext_bytes = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext_hex)
flagpart = "udctf{"

def find_key(ciphertext, flagpart):
    possible_keys = []
    for i in range(len(ciphertext) - len(flagpart) + 1):
        xor_result = xor(ciphertext[i:i+len(flagpart)], flagpart.encode())
        if xor_result.isalnum():
            possible_keys.append((i, xor_result.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')))
    return possible_keys

keys = find_key(ciphertext_bytes, flagpart)
for idx, key_part in keys:
    print(f"Found key segment at position {idx}: {key_part}")
```

Then it hit us ‚Äî the challenge name, "Looper," was no accident! It hinted that our partial key should loop, leading us to the classic full XOR key: deadbeef. A CTF favorite, `deadbeef`.

### Get the flag 


``` python
def xor(msg, key):
    o = b''
    for i in range(len(msg)):
        o += bytes([msg[i] ^ key[i % len(key)]])
    return o

ciphertext_hex = "11010210041e125508065109073a11563b1d51163d16060e54550d19"
ciphertext_bytes = bytes.fromhex(ciphertext_hex)

# 'deadbeef' -> repeating key
full_key = "deadbeef"
decrypted_message = xor(ciphertext_bytes, full_key.encode())

print(f"Decrypted message: {decrypted_message.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')}")

```
```flag udctf{w3lc0me_t0_x0r_sch00l} ```

# Training Problem: Intro to Reverse - training - reversing

We started by analyzing the given binary in IDA Pro, where we noticed a validation check on user input inline to the challenge description

String in Binary: The binary contains a hardcoded string, `ucaqbvl,n*d\\'R#!!l`, stored in v5.
Validation Logic: The program takes input and checks if each character in the input, adjusted by its index (s[i] - i), matches the corresponding character in v5.

### Reversing the Check
Using the observed transformation, we wrote a Python script to generate the correct input by reversing the logic.

``` python
v5 = "ucaqbvl,n*d\\'R#!!l"
s = ''.join(chr(ord(v5[i]) + i) for i in range(len(v5)))
print(s)
```

# üÖ±Ô∏èrainrot.c - reversing
The challenge, Brainrot, required translating code words from the "brainrot" format and then reversing the logic to reveal part of the flag. After breaking down the logic and using translation techniques, we were left with a 4-letter word to complete the flag.
### Solution
- Code Translation: We translated the given "brainrot" words back into their intended text format.
- Logic Reversal: We reversed the logical checks used in the challenge, piecing together the final portion of the flag.
- Final Search: A quick Google search confirmed the 4-letter word we needed: `ohio`.

#### Test the flag
```python
flag = "udctf{Hi_am_th3_un5p0k3n_0_!0_5ki8idi_gyatt_r!zz13r}"
print(f"Testing flag: {flag}")
print(f"Flag length: {len(flag)}")
test_flag(flag)
```


``udctf{Hi_am_th3_un5p0k3n_0_!0_5ki8idi_gyatt_r!zz13r}``

Upon analyzing the flag, we noticed the 0_!0 segment, which was key to completing the flag. After decoding the logic and piecing together the partial flag, we conducted a quick Google search for common brainrot words and discovered that "ohio" is a popular choice. This helped us fill in the missing 4-letter word.```0_!0``` ```u d c t f {Hi_am _th3_un5p0k3n_0_!0 _5ki8idi_gyatt_r!zz13r} ```

*Final flag: udctf{i_am_th3_un5p0k3n_0h!0_5ki8idi_gyatt_r!zz13r}*


# AlgebrarbeglA - misc

# Just a day at the breach - lambda - crypto - web

Question:
```python
import os
import json
import zlib

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    try:
        payload=bytes.fromhex(event["queryStringParameters"]["payload"])
        flag = os.environ["flag"].encode()
        message = b"Your payload is: %b\nThe flag is: %b" % (payload, flag)
        compressed_length = len(zlib.compress(message,9))
    except ValueError as e:
        return {'statusCode': 500, "error": str(e)}

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({"sniffed": compressed_length})
    }
```


Solution:
char by char brute. Getting the smallest length is the correct character and appending it to the other resolved ones to complete the flag 


```python

    hex_payload = payload.encode().hex()
    response = requests.get(url, params={'payload': hex_payload})
    return char, response.json().get('sniffed')

while True:
    min_length = float('inf')
    next_char = ''

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:  # Adjust max_workers based on network capacity
        futures = [executor.submit(get_compressed_length, char) for char in possible_chars]

        for future in as_completed(futures):
            char, compressed_length = future.result()
            if compressed_length < min_length:

                next_char = char

    if next_char:
        known_flag += next_char

    else:
        break

# Nonogram Pt. 1: Simple Enough - crypto

### Question:
When you get past the puzzle, you now face a classic encryption / old-school stego encoding. Wrap the text you find in `UDCTF{TEXTHERE}``.

### Solution

This was a nonogram puzzle

- Nonogram Solver: We started with the nonogram puzzle and used https://fedimser.github.io/nonogram tool to recreate and solve the puzzle pattern provided. The solution revealed a coded message that required further analysis.

- Cipher Identification: Next, we used dcode.fr‚Äôs Cipher Identifier to determine which cipher could have been used. We tested multiple options, and Bacon Cipher emerged as the solution.

- Decoding: With Bacon Cipher identified, we decoded the message, which revealed the encoded string

# Training Problem: Intro to RSA - crypto

### Question:

```python
In [9]: p = getPrime(128)
In [10]: q = getPrime(128)
In [11]: N = p*q
In [12]: bytes_to_long(flag) < N
Out[12]: True
In [13]: print(pow(bytes_to_long(flag), 65537, N), N)

```


### Solution 

#### Step 1: Understand the RSA Parameters Given
In RSA encryption, the public key consists of:

N = p x ùëû
N=p√óq: the product of two prime numbers.
ùëí:  the public exponent, which is given as 65537.

We also know:
`flag` is a message that was encrypted with the public key, and
The result of the encryption `(c = pow(bytes_to_long(flag), e, N)) is given.`

The goal is to find the original message, `flag`.

####  Step 2: Factorize N

We use [FactorDb](https://factordb.com/index.php?query=51328431690246050000196200646927542588629192646276628974445855970986472407007) into factorize ùëÅ into ùëù and ùëû

#### Step 3: Calculate the Private Key Exponent 

The private exponent ùëë  is calculated using the modular inverse of e
e with respect to (p‚àí1)(ùëû‚àí1) which allows us to decrypt messages encrypted with ùëí
In mathematical terms: mod((p‚àí1)(q‚àí1))

#### Step 4: Decrypt the Ciphertext
Now that we have  ùëë we can decrypt the ciphertext ùëê using the RSA decryption formula:


Here, m is the decrypted message as an integer. We can then convert it back to bytes and decode it to reveal the original flag.
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

# Extended GCD for modular inverse
def extended_gcd(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b, 0, 1
    gcd, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)
    x = y1 - (b // a) * x1
    y = x1
    return gcd, x, y

# Modular inverse using extended GCD
def modinv(a, m):
    _, x, _ = extended_gcd(a, m)
    return (x % m + m) % m

# Given values
N = 51328431690246050000196200646927542588629192646276628974445855970986472407007

# Factored values from factordb
p = 186574907923363749257839451561965615541
q = 275108975057510790219027682719040831427

# Verify N = p * q
assert p * q == N, "Factors are correct!"

# Calculate œÜ(N)
phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)

# Calculate private key d
d = modinv(e, phi)

# Decrypt the message
m = pow(c, d, N)

# Convert to bytes and print the flag
flag = long_to_bytes(m)
print(flag)
```
