## 💡 Your Pitch (Copy/Paste This)

```
I built a Security Header Checker - a professional pentesting tool that solves a real problem security professionals face daily.

WHAT IT DOES:
- Scans any website for 7 critical security headers
- Provides a security score (0-100) with severity-based weighting
- Shows missing headers with actionable fix recommendations
- Exports results to JSON for integration with other tools
- Professional output suitable for client reports

WHY IT'S USEFUL:
Security headers are critical for preventing XSS, clickjacking, and MITM attacks, but they're often overlooked. This tool makes it instant and easy to identify missing headers during pentesting engagements, DevOps deployments, or security audits.

REAL-WORLD VALUE:
- Saves hours during security assessments
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines
- Helps developers understand security best practices
- Production-ready - can be used TODAY

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- 250 lines of clean Python code
- Minimal dependencies (just requests)
- Handles errors gracefully
- Tested on multiple sites (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Works on any platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)

This isn't a proof-of-concept - it's a tool that belongs in every pentester's toolkit.

## 🎤 If Judges Ask Questions

**Q: Why is this useful?**
A: Security headers prevent XSS, clickjacking, and MITM attacks. This tool makes checking them instant instead of manual. Saves hours during pentesting.

**Q: How is this different from online checkers?**
A: 1) Command-line tool (scriptable, CI/CD integration), 2) Severity-based scoring, 3) JSON export, 4) Can scan internal/private sites, 5) No data sent to third parties.

**Q: Who would use this?**
A: Penetration testers (first-pass assessment), DevOps engineers (deployment verification), security consultants (client audits), developers (learning best practices).

**Q: Could this be extended?**
A: Yes! Batch scanning, historical tracking, framework-specific fixes, CVE lookup, HTML reports, Slack notifications. This is a solid foundation.
